    <h1>Unrequited Love</h1>
    <p>
      In the depth of Unrequited endearment , <br />
      With hopes and longings and cravings , <br />
      I find myself dwell in realm of one sided love , <br />
      In the nostalgia that's exclusively mine. <br /><br />

      I watch from afar, hidden in shadows , <br />
      Admiring your existence from a distance , <br />
      Like a sunflower trying to reach the sun , <br />
      Unseen , unheard and yet lingering in depth of consciousness. <br /><br />

      For the every smile you show the world ,<br />
      For the every twinkle in your eyes ,<br />
      Each moment it aches deeper ,<br />
      As I cherish your presence every now and then.<br /><br />

      I know that you don't belong to me ,<br />
      I have realization that I can never have you<br />
      Yet I Envision your presence on canvas of my dreams ,<br />
      embracing the hope that our paths may one day intertwine.<br /><br />

      Until then, I'll carry this unrequited love,<br />
      With grace, with strength, with a gentle sigh,<br />
      Waiting for a magical moment to happen ,<br />
      In the fictional world where you're mine.<br /><br /><br />
